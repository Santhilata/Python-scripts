Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a 
given target value.  Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n). 
 If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].  
 Forexample, given [5,7,7,8,8,10] and target value 8, return [3,4]
